# Cryptography 
* In Greek, Crypto mean " Hidden, secret "

* Confidentiality, Its a secret 

* Authentication and access control

* Non-repudiation, you said it, you cant deny it

* Integrity, Tamper-proof

# Plaintext
* Uncrypted message (in the clear)

* Ciphertext, An encrypted message

* Cipher, The algorithm used to encrypt and or decrypt data

* Cryptanalysis, The art of cracking encryption 

# Cryptographic keys
* Keys, The key added to the cipher to decrpy 

# Give weak keys a workout
* A weak key is a weak key

* Make a weak key stronger by performing mulitple processes

* Hash makes the hacker have to guess the password

# Key stretching libraries
* Already built for your application

* Bcrypt, Genereates hashes from passwords

* PAssword-Based key derivation, RCA keys

# Lightweight cryptography
* Powerful cryptography has traditionally required strength

* Internet of Things (IoT) Devices have limited power 

* New standards are being created, NIST 

# Homomorphic encryption (HE)
* Encrypted data is difficult to work with

* Perform calculation of data while its encrypted

* Many advantages 

# Symmetric encryption
* A single, shared key

* Decrypr with the same key

* IF it gets out, you will need another key

* Secret key algorithm, a shared secret

* Can be challenging to distribute

* Very fast to use

# Asymmetric encryption
* Public key cryptography, Public and private key

* Private key, Keep this key

* Public key, Anyone can see this key, Give it away

* The private key is the only key that can decrpy data encrypted with a public key

# The key pair
* Both keys are bulit at the same time, The public and Private key

* Everyone can have the public key while its not the same for the private

# Elliptic curve cryptography
* Asymmetric encryption, Need large integers composed of two or more large prime factors

* Use smaller keys than non-ECC asymmetric encryption

* Smaller, Uses curves. This is ideal for IoT devices. 

# Hash 
* Represent data as a short string of text, A message digest, a fingerprint

* One-way trip, Impossible to recover the orginal message from the digest, USed to store passwords / confidentially 

* Verify a downloaded document is the same as the orginal, Integrity

* Can be a digital signature, Authentication, Non-repudiation, and integrity 

* Will not have a collision

# SHA256 hash
* 256 bits / 64 hexadecimal

# Collision
* Take an input of any size, Create a fixed size string

* THe hash should be unque, different inputs should never create the same hash

* MD5 has a collision problem 

# Practical hashing
* Verify a downloaded file, Hasehs may be provided on the download site, Compare the downloaded file hash with the posted hash value

* Password storage, Instead of sotring the password, store a hash 

# Adding some salt
* Random data added to passwords when hashing

* Ading randomization to the hashing process, the same password will show up different

* Rainbow tables will not work with salted hashes

# Digital signatures
* PRove the message has not changed

* Prove the source of the message, Authentication

* Make sure the signature isn't fake 

* Sign with the private key

* Verify with the public key

# Cryptographic Keys
* There's very little that isn't known

* The key determines the output, The private key is how people gain access

# Key strength
* Larger keys tend to be more secure

* Symmetric encryprtion, 128-bits or larger symmetric keys are common

* asymmetric encryption, Complex calculation of prime numbers

# Key exchange
* A logistical challenge 

* Out-of-band key exchange, dont send the symmetric key over the net

* Telephone, courier, in-person

* Protect the key with addiontional encryption method

# Real-time encryption/decryptionm
* There's a need for fast security 

* Share a symmetric session key using asymmetric encryption

* Implement session keys carefully 

# Traditional web server encryptionm
* SSL ( Secure sockets layer) /TLS uses encryption keys to protect web server

* This servers private key can rebuild everything 

* One point of failure for all of you web site encryption

# Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)
* Change the method of key exchange

* Elliptic curve or Diffie-Hellman ephemeral

* Cant decrypt with the private server key 

* PFS requires more computing power

* The browser must support PFS
