# Cryptography 
* In Greek, Crypto mean " Hidden, secret "

* Confidentiality, Its a secret 

* Authentication and access control

* Non-repudiation, you said it, you cant deny it

* Integrity, Tamper-proof

# Plaintext
* Uncrypted message (in the clear)

* Ciphertext, An encrypted message

* Cipher, The algorithm used to encrypt and or decrypt data

* Cryptanalysis, The art of cracking encryption 

# Cryptographic keys
* Keys, The key added to the cipher to decrpy 

# Give weak keys a workout
* A weak key is a weak key

* Make a weak key stronger by performing mulitple processes

* Hash makes the hacker have to guess the password

# Key stretching libraries
* Already built for your application

* Bcrypt, Genereates hashes from passwords

* PAssword-Based key derivation, RCA keys

# Lightweight cryptography
* Powerful cryptography has traditionally required strength

* Internet of Things (IoT) Devices have limited power 

* New standards are being created, NIST 

# Homomorphic encryption (HE)
* Encrypted data is difficult to work with

* Perform calculation of data while its encrypted

* Many advantages 

# Symmetric encryption
* A single, shared key

* Decrypr with the same key

* IF it gets out, you will need another key

* Secret key algorithm, a shared secret

* Can be challenging to distribute

* Very fast to use

# Asymmetric encryption
* Public key cryptography, Public and private key

* Private key, Keep this key

* Public key, Anyone can see this key, Give it away

* The private key is the only key that can decrpy data encrypted with a public key

# The key pair
* Both keys are bulit at the same time, The public and Private key

* Everyone can have the public key while its not the same for the private
