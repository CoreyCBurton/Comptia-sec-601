# Penetration Testing
* Simulate an attack 

* Similar to vulnerability scanning; we try to exploit the vulnerabilities

* Often a compliance mandate; 3rd-party testing

# Rules of engagement 
* An important document 

* Type of testing and schedule; On-site physical breach, internal test, external test

* The rules; IP address, Emergency contacts, How to handle sensitive information, In-scope and out-of-scope devices

# Working knowledge 
* How much do you know about the test; many different approaches

* Unkown environment; Blind test

* Known environment; Full disclousre

* Partially known environment; A mix of known and unkown, Focus on certian systems or applications\

# Exploiting vulnerabilities
* Try to break into the system; Gain privilage escalation, Bufferoverflows can cause instability

# Lateral movement 
* Move from system to system, The inside of the network is unprotected 

# Persistence
* Once you gain access, you need to gain backdoor access 

# The pivot 
* Gain access to systems that would normally not be accessible

* Use a vulnerable system as a proxy or relay 

# White box 
* Having all the knowledge of the applications and testing the internal workings

# Black box
* Outside the network with little or no prior knowledge 

# Gray box
* Combination of white and black box testing, Search for defects. 

# Reconnaissance 
* Need information before the attack 

* Gathering a digital foorprint

* Understand the security posture

* Minimize the attack area; Create a network map 

# Passive footprint
* Learn as much as you can from open sources

* Social media and corporate websites. 

* Social engineering 

# Openm Source Intelligence (OSINT)
* Gater information from many open sources; Find information on anyone or anything; Data is everywhere 

* Automated gathering which can gather information fast 

# Wardriving or warflying
* Combine WiFi monitoring and a GPS; search from your car or plane

* Huge amount of intel in a short period of time

* All of this info can be done for free; Kismet, inSSlDer, wigle.net 

# Active footprinting
* Trying the doors and visible on netowrk traffic

* Ping scans, port scans 

* DNS queries

* OS scans, OS fingerprinting 

* People can see that we are preforming these task 

# Red-team
* Offensive security team

* Ethical hacking; find security holes

* Exploit vulnerabilities; gain access

* Social engineering attack

# Blue team
* Defensive security; protecting data

* Operational security; daily security tasks

* Incident response; Damage control

* Threat hunting; find and fix the holes 

* Digital forensics; find data everywhere 

# Purple team 
* Red and blue teams work together.

* Deploy applications and data securely

# White team
* Not on a side, the referees in a security exercise. Enofrces the rules and resolves any issues 

* Manages the post-event assessments
