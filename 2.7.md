# Barricades / bollard
* Prevent access, there are limits to the prevention

* Channel people htrough a specific access point

* Identify safety concerns

* Can be used to an extreme 

# Access control vestibules
* Opening one door causes others to lock 

* All doors are normally locked, Unlocking one door precvents others from being unlocked 

* One door open / other locked

* One at a time, controlled groups 

# Alarms
* Circuit based- Circuit is opened or closed

* Door, WIndow, Fence

* USeful on the perimeter

* Motion detection, Radio frequences 

* Duress, Triggered by a person 

# Signs 
* Clear and specific instructions

* Keep people away from restricted areas

# Video surveillance 
* CCTV (Closed circuit television) 

* Camera features are important

* Motion recognition can alarm and alert when something moves

* Often many different cameras

# Industrial camoflage 
* Conceal an important facility in plain sight 

* Protect a data center, No business signs, visual clues, Surround it with a water feature

# Guards and access lists
* Security guard, Physical protection at the reception area of a factility 

* ID badge, Picture name and other details

* Must be worn at all times 

# Guards 
* Two-person intefrity/control

* Minimize exposure to an attack

* NO single person has access to a physoical asset

* RObot sentries, Monitoring, rounds/periodic checks 

# Biometrics 
* Biometric authentication, Fingerprint, retina, voiceprint

* Usually stores a mathmetical representation of your biometric

* Difficult to change 

* Used in very specific situations 

# Door access controls
* Conventional 

* Deadbolt

* Electronic

* Token-based

# Cable locks
* Temporary security, connect your hardware

* Cable works almost anywhere

* Most devices have a standard connector

# USB data blocker
* Dont connect unkown USB interfaces 

* Use a USB data blocker, allow voltage and reject data

* Use your power adapter, avoid the issue entirely 

# Proper lighting
* More light means more security

* Specialized design 

# Fencing
* Build a perimeter

* Transparent or opaque, see through the fence (or not) 

* Robust, Difficult to cut the fence

* Prevent climbing

# Fire suppression
* Electronics require unique repsonses to fire

* Detection, Smoke detector, Flame detector, Heat detector

* Suppress with water 

# Sensors 
* Motion detection, Identify movement in an area 

* Noise detection, Recognize an increase in sound

* Proimity reader, Commonly used with electronic door

* Moisture detection, USer

# Drones
* Quiclky cover large areas

* More than physical security, Site survey or damage assessments

# Faraday case
* Blocks electromagnetic fields

* A mesh of conductive material 

* Not a comprehensive solution 

# Screened subnet
* Formerly known as a demilitarized zone (DMZ)

* An additional layer of security between the internet 

# Protected distribution 
* Protected Distribution System (PDS)

* PRotect your cables and fibers 

* Prevent cable and fiber taps

# Secure areas
* Physically secure the data, As important as the digital security

* An important part of a security policy

* Secure active operaions

* Secure offline data

# Air gap
* Physical separation between networks

* Most environments are shared, Shared routers, switches, firewalls

* Specialized networks require an air gap, Stock market, SCADA, Airplanes, Nuclear power plants 

# Vaults and safes
* A secure reinforced room

* Store backup media

* Protect from disaster or theft 

# Hot and cold aisles
* Data centers, Lots and losts of equipment 

* Optimize cooling, Keep components at optimal temperatures

* Conserve energy, Data cetners are usually very large rooms, FOcus the cooling

# Data destruction and media sanitizaion
* Disposal becomes a legal issue, Some information must not be destoryed

* Consider offsite storage

# Protect your rubbish
* Secure your garbage, Fence the lock

* Shred your documents, This will go so far

* Burn documents, no going back

* Pulp the paper, large tank washing to remove ink

# Physical destruction
* Heavy machinery 

* Drill/Hammer, Quick and easy

* Electromagnetic ( degaussing )

* Can also burn digital media

# Certificate of destruction
* Destruction is often done by a 3rd party

* A third party confirms that a certificate was destroyed, A paper trail of broken detail

# Sanitizing media
* PPurge data, Remove it from an exisisitng data store

* Delete some of the data from a database

* Wipe data, Unrevoerable removale of data

# Data security
* UK national Health Service, A third party sold data instead of destorying it
