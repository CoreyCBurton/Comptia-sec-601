# Zero day
* A software Vulnerability

* A vulnerability that has been discovered but the company does not know about 

# Weak configurations

# Open Permissions
* Users have to many Permissions towards sensitive data

* Open door where the hacker can just walk on in

> 14 million Verizon records exposed; Third-party left an Amazon S3 dta repository open

# Unsecure root accounts
* Root is easy to access which gives the user privileges to do what they want 

* Some Root passwords can be weak 

# Erros
* Errors give too much informtion to the hacker 

* Errors can give service type, version information, debug data

> Patreon was compromised; debugger to help monitor and troubleshoot website issues

# Weak encrpytion
* Easy to crack hashes can lead to information being stolen

* Encrpytion protocol (AES,3DES)

* Length of encrpytion is important and make sure wireless encryption is used

# Insecure protocols
* Having outdated protocols can lead to vulnerabilities in the network 

* Some protocols aren't encrypted 

* Verify a packet caputre to make sure it is encrypted

# Default settings
* Default settings make it easy for the hacker to get in. Default passwords is a huge vulnerability.

* Mirai botnet takes advantage of default configurations

# Open ports and servies
* Ports that accept packets is an open port 

* Some open ports can be misconfigured, unpatched, and vulnerable to exploits 

* Make sure firewalls are in place 

# Third-party risks
* IT security doesn't change because it's a third-party

* Always plan for the worst; Human error is still a big issue

# System intergration
* Professional installation and maintenance 

* Can be on-site with physica or virtual access 

* Less security on the inside; Port scanners and traffic captures

* Can run software on the internet network

# Lack of vendor support
* Security requires diligence

* vendors are the only ones who can fix the products 

> Trane Comfortlink 2 thermostats: there were three vulnerabilites in april 2014. The patches were then released on April 2015

# Supply chain
* You cant always control security at a third-party location 

* Always maintain local security control

* Hardware and software from a vendor can contain malware 

* Counterfeit hardware is out there

# Outsourced code deveoplment 
* Access the code base 

* Cloud-base access 

* Verify security to other systems

* Test the code security; check for backdoors 

# Data storage
* Consider the type of data; Contact the type of data

* Storage at a third=party location needs encryption; the input and output

# Improper or weak patch management 
* The update server determines when you patch; Test all your apps, then deploy

# Firmware 
*  The BIOS of the device

# Operating system
* Monthly and on-demand patches

# Applications 
* Provided by the manufacturer as-needed

> Equifax had a data break 147.9 million and many more. Apache Struts, a patch that was idenitifed on March 7, 2017. Wasent patched till July 30th

# Legacy platforms
* Some devices remain installed for a long time

* Legac devices with older operating systems, applications, middleware

* May be running end-of-life software 

# Impacts
* Malicious cyber activity cost between 57 billion and 109 billion in 2016 

* More than just finances 

# Data loss
* Vulnerability unsecured data bases; no password or default password

* internet facing databases are being deleted

* Thousands of databases are missing

* Overwrites data with the word "meow";  no message or motive

# Identity theft
* Equifax had data stolen in July 2017

# Financial Loss
* Bank of Bangladesh; Society for Worldwide interbank 

* Attackers set secure messages to transfer nearly one billion dollars 

# Reputation impacts
* Getting hacked isn't a great look

> October 2016 - uber breach 25.6 million names, email addresses, and mobile phone numbers; They paid 148 million in fines

# Availability loss
* Outages and downtown

* Pervasive ransomware threat
