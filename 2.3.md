# Development to production
* How will you deploy it safely and reliably

* Patch Tuesday, Test and deploy Wednesday, or some set day

* Manage the process, safely move from a non-production phase to full production 

# Sandboxing
* Isolated testing environment, no connection to the real world or production system

* Try some code, Break some code, nobody gets hurt

* Incremental development 

# Development
* Secure environment 

* Writing code

* Developers test in their sandboxes

# Test
* Still in the development stage

* All of the pieces are put together 

# Verifying the application
* QA team or quality Assurance; 

* Verifies features are working as expected 

* Staging; Almost ready to roll out, more test

* Working with a copy of production data; Run performance tests

# Using the application
* Application is live, rolled out to the user community

* A challenging step, impacts users 

* Logistical challenges, New servers, New software. Restart or interrupt service 

# Secure baselines 
* All application instances must follow this baseline

* Firewall settings, patch levels, OS file versions

* Find immedate corrections 

# Provisioning 
* Deploy an application, webserver, database server, middleware server, user workstation, certificate updates.

* Application software security, operating system 

* Network security, VLAN, internet access, external access 

# Scalability and elasticity
* HAndle application workload

* Scalability, the ability to increase the workload in a given infrastructure 

* Build an application instrance that can handle 100,000 transactions per second

# Orchestration
* Automation is the key to cloud computing, Services appear and disappear automatically 

* Entire application isntances can be instantly provisioned, All servers, networks, switches, firewalls, and policies

# Deprovisioning 
* Dismantling and removing an application instance

* Security deprovisining is important 

* Firewall policies must be reverted

# Secure coding concepts
* A balance between time and quality

* Testing, Testing, testing, The QA process

# Stores procedure
* SQL databases

* Client requests can be complex

* Stored procedures limit the client interactions

* Allows the user to not make any outside data base calls

# Obfuscation/camouflage
* Make something normally understandable, very difficult to understand

* Only helps prevent the search for humans

# Code reuse/dead code
* Code reuse, copy and paste

* If the old code has security vulnerabilities, reusing the code that spreads to other applications

# Input validation
* What is the expected input, validate actual vs. expected

* Document all input methods

* Check and correct all input (normalization)

* Check and correct all input, A zip code should be only X characters

* Fix any data with improper input

* The fuzzers will find what you missed

# Validatrion points
* Server-side validation, checks occur on the server, Help protect against malicious users

* Client-side validation, The end-user's app makes the validation decisions 

* Can filter legitmate input from genuine users 

# Memory management
* As a developer, you myst be mindful of how memeory is used

* Never trust data input, Malicious user can attempt to circument your code

* Ex - Buffer overflows

# Third-party livraries and SDKs
* Your programming language does everything

* Third-party libraries and software development kits (SDKs) 

* There is a security risk, it was written by someone else 

# Data exposure
* So much sensitive data, Credit card numbers, social security numbers, medical information

* Know how the application is handling data, Encryption and other information

* All input and output process are important 

# Version Control
* Create a file, make a change, make another change

* Commonly used in software development 

* Useful for security

# Exploiting an application
* Attackers often exploit application vulnerabilites

* Once you explout one binary, you can exploit them all

# Software diversity
* Alternative compliter paths would result in a different binary each time

* An attack against different binaries would only be successful on a traction of the users

# Automation and scripting
* Plan for change, implement automatically

* Automated courses of action, many problems can be predicted

* Continous monitoring 

* Configuration validation 

# Continuous integration
* Code is constantly written

* Chances for security problems 

* Basic set of security checks during development 

* Even more security checkes

# Continuous delivery/deployment
* Automate the testing process

* Automate the release process

* Click a button and deploy the application

* Continuous deployment

# Directory services
* Keep all of an organizations username and passwords in a single database

* Large distributed database

* All authentication requests reference this directory

# Federation
* Provide network access to others, Not just employees, Partners, suppliers, customers, etc. 

* Third parties can establush a federated network, Authenticate and authroize 

* Third parties must establish a trust relationship 

* EX - Log in with twitter, Log in with Facebook, Log in with Linkedin 

# Attestation
* Prove the hardware is really yours, a system you can trust

* Easy when it's just your computer, 

* Remote attestation, device provides an operational report to a verficiation server

* Encrypted and digitally signed with the TPM

* AN IMEI or other unqiue hardware component can be included in report 

# Short message service (SMS)
* Text messaging

* Login factor can be sent via SMS to a predefined phone number

* Input the SMS code in into the log in fourm

* Securits issue exist, Phone number can be reassigned, SMS can be intercepted

# Push notification
* Similar process to an SMS notification

* Usally on a mobile device

* Security challenges, Application can be vulnerable

# Authentication Apps
* Carry around a physical hardware token generator, USe software-based token generator on your phone

# TOTP
* TIme-based One-TIme Password Allorithm

* Secret key is configured ahead of time 

* Timestamp usually increments every 30 seconds 

# HOTP 
* HMAC-based One-Time Password ALhorithm

* Token based authentication, The hash is different every time

# Phone call 
* A voice call provides the token

* The voice will tell you the code 

* phone call be intercepted or forwarded

# Static codes
* Authentication factors that don't change 

* PErsonal identification Number (PIN)

* Can also be alphanumeric, paraphase

# Smart cards
* Intergrated circuit card

* Common on credit cards but also used on identities 

* Multiple factors, Use the card with a PIN or fingerprint

# Niometric Factors ( Something you are )
* Fingerprint scanner, Phones. Laptops, door access 

* Retinal scanner, Inique capillary structure in the back of the eye

* Iris scanner, Texture, color

* Voice recognition, Talk for access

* Facial recognition, shape of the face and features 

* Gait analysis - Identify a person based on how they walk 

* Veins - Vascular scanners, Match the surface of the skin

# Biometric acceptance rates
* False acceptance rate (FAR), Likelihood that an unauthroized user will be accpeted, not sensitive enough

* False rejection rate (FRR), Likelihood that an authorized user will be rejected 

* Crossover error rate (CER), Defines the overall accuracy of a biuometric system 

# AAA Framwork ( Authentication, Authorization, and Accoutning ) 
* Identification, This is who you claim to be, can be your user name 

* Authentication, ORive who you say you are, PAssword and other authentication factors

* Authorization, based on your identification and authentication 

* Accounting, resource used, Login time, data sent, logout time

# Cloud vs on-premises Authentication
* Cloud-based security, centralized platoform, centralized platform, Automation options with API integration 

* On-premises authentication system, Internal moniotring and management

# Factors 
- Something you know
- Something you have
- Something you are 

# Attributes
- Somewhere you are
- Something you can do
- Something you exhibit
- Someone you know 

# Something you know
* It is in your brain, password, 

* PIN and patterns, Not written down, it is in your brain

# Something you have
* Smart card, integrates with devices. It has a PIN. May require a pin

* USB token, A certiciate is on the USB device

* Hardware or software tokens, Generates pseudo-random authentication codes

* Your phone, an sms you have

# Something you are
* Biometric authentication, fingerprint, iris scan, voice print

* Difficult to change, you cant change your password, Not fool proof

# Somewhere you are
* Provide a factor based on your location 

* IP address, not perfect, but can help provide more info 

* Mobile devlice location services

# Something you can do 
* A personal way of doing things, Handwriting analysis

* very similar to biometrics, close but not quite

# Someone you know
* A social factor 

* web of trust

* Digital signature
