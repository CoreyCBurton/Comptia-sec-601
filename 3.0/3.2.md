# Antivirus
-  Software that is characterized by signature-based detection and prevention of known virsus.
   - On access antivirus scanner or intrusion prevention system works by identifying when processes or scripts are executed and intercepted. 

# Anti-malware
- Malware detection, Virsus, Worms, Trojans, Spyware, PUPs, Cryptojackers
  - It captures signatures but unfortunately it is not consistant

# Endpoint detection and response (EDR)
- Confifure the management system to push the ahaent software and updates 
  - Assign hosts to appropriate groups for policy assignment; Isolate a client when a threat is detected
  - Test the differnt host groups configuration setting to ensure that the expected range of threats are detected
  - Use a monitoring dashboard to verify status across all network hosts.

# Data Loss Prevention
- Many Endpoint Protection Platforms have a Data Loss Prevention agent
  - There are configured policies to identigy privileged files and string that should be kept privae or confidential 
  - The agent enforces the policy to prevent data from being copied or attached to a message without authorization

# Next-generation firewall (NGFW) 
- Host or network firewall capable of parsing application layer protocol header and data 
  - Product combined application-aware filtering with user account-based filitering and the ability to act as an intrusion prevention system

# Host-Based Intrusion Detection (HIDS) / Host-Based Intrusion Prevention (HIPS)
- Host-based intrusion detection systems provide threat detection via log and file system monitoring 
  - HIDS come in many different forms with different capabilities 

- HIPS
  - File system integrity monitoring uses signatures and monitor ports

# Host-based firewall
- A software application running on a single host and designed to protect that host
  - Implemented as a software application running on a single host designed to protect that host only.
  - Also enforcing packet filtering ACLs, a personal firewall
