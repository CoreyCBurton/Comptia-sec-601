# Antivirus
-  Software that is characterized by signature-based detection and prevention of known virsus.
   - On access antivirus scanner or intrusion prevention system works by identifying when processes or scripts are executed and intercepted. 

# Anti-malware
- Malware detection, Virsus, Worms, Trojans, Spyware, PUPs, Cryptojackers
  - It captures signatures but unfortunately it is not consistant

# Endpoint detection and response (EDR)
- Confifure the management system to push the ahaent software and updates 
  - Assign hosts to appropriate groups for policy assignment; Isolate a client when a threat is detected
  - Test the differnt host groups configuration setting to ensure that the expected range of threats are detected
  - Use a monitoring dashboard to verify status across all network hosts.

# Data Loss Prevention
- Many Endpoint Protection Platforms have a Data Loss Prevention agent
  - There are configured policies to identigy privileged files and string that should be kept privae or confidential 
  - The agent enforces the policy to prevent data from being copied or attached to a message without authorization

# Next-generation firewall (NGFW) 
- Host or network firewall capable of parsing application layer protocol header and data 
  - Product combined application-aware filtering with user account-based filitering and the ability to act as an intrusion prevention system

# Host-Based Intrusion Detection (HIDS) / Host-Based Intrusion Prevention (HIPS)
- Host-based intrusion detection systems provide threat detection via log and file system monitoring 
  - HIDS come in many different forms with different capabilities 

- HIPS
  - File system integrity monitoring uses signatures and monitor ports

# Host-based firewall
- A software application running on a single host and designed to protect that host
  - Implemented as a software application running on a single host designed to protect that host only.
  - Also enforcing packet filtering ACLs, a personal firewall 

# Unified extensible firmware interface (UEFI)
- A system firmware providing support for 64-bit CPU operation at boot, full GUI, and mouse operation 
  - PRovides code that allows the host to boot to an OS

# Measured boot
- A UEFI feature that gathers secure metrics to validate the boot process in an attestation report
  - Checks whether hashes of key streams state data ( Boot firmware, Boot loader, OS kernel, etc.
 
 # Boot attestation
 - Report of boot state integrity data that is signed by a tamper-proof TPM key and is reported to a network server
   - The boot log can be analyzed for signs of compromise, such as the persence of unsigned drivers.

> Secure boot settings in UEFI

# Tokenization
- Replace sensitive data with a non-sensitive place holder
  - Example - SSN 266-12-1112 which is now 691-61-8539
  - This is not encryption or hashing 

# Hashing a password
- Hashes represent data as a fixed-length string of text
  - A message digest, or "fingerprint"
  - A common way to store passwords

# Adding some salt
- Random data added to a password when hashing
  - Every yser gets their own random salt 
  - Stops rainbow tables with hashes
  - Slows down brute force attacks 

# Secure cookies
- Cookies are a vector for session hijacking and data exposure if not configured correftly
  - Some key parameters for the set cookies are
  1. Avoid using persistent cookies for session authentication
  2. Set the Secure attribute to make the cookies inaccessible to document object/model/client-side scripting
  3. USe the SameSite attribute to control where a cookie may be sent 

# HTTP Headers
- A number of security options can be set in response to the header returned by the server. 
  - Developers are constrained by compatibility and implementation between different client browser and server software types.
  - Options to help with security are
  1. HTTP Strict Transport Security - Forces browser to connect using HTTPS only
  2. COntent Security Policy - mitigates clickjacking, script injection, etc
  3. Cache-control - Sets whether the browser can cache responsesz

# Input validations
- Any technique used to ensure that the data entered into a field or variable in an application is handled appropriately by that application
  - SQL injections 
  - To prevent, all input methods should be tested and documented

# Code Signing
- The principal means of proving the authenticity and integrity of code ( Executabke or a script )
  - The developer creates a cryptographic hash or files that signs the hash using the private key. 

# Manual code review
- The process of peer review of uncompiled source code by other developers 
  - Identify oversights, mistaken assumptions, or a lack of knowledge or experience.

# Dynamic code analysis
- The application is tested under real world conditions by using a staging environment 
  - Example: exposure to race conditions or unexpected user input

# Fuzzing
- A dynamic code analysis technique that involves sending a running application random and unusual input so as to evaluate how the app responds. 
  - Means of testing an application in which input validation routines work well
  - input and recordes repsonses made by the applications
