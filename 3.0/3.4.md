# Securing a wireless network
- An organization wireless network can contain confidential information

- Authenitcate the users before granting access
  - Who gets access to the wireless network

- Ensure all communication is confidential

# Wireless encryption
- All wireless computers are radio transmitters and receivers 
  - Anyone can listen
  - Encrypting the data will be the solution

# WiFi protected access (WPA2)
- CCMP block cipher block chaining 
  - Created in 2004
  - CCMP security servies (AES protocol)

- Has a brute-force problem
  - PSK brute-force problem
 
# WPA 3
- GCMP block cipher mode
  - Galois/Counter mode protocol
  - A stronger envryption than WPA2
  - GCMP security services

# Simultaneous Authentication (SAE)
- WPA3 uses PSK authentication process
  - Includes mutual authenitcation
  - Creates a shared session key without sending that key across the network
  - No hashes, no brute force attacks

- In sae, everyone uses a different session key
