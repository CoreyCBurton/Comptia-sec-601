# Securing a wireless network
- An organization wireless network can contain confidential information

- Authenitcate the users before granting access
  - Who gets access to the wireless network

- Ensure all communication is confidential

# Wireless encryption
- All wireless computers are radio transmitters and receivers 
  - Anyone can listen
  - Encrypting the data will be the solution

# WiFi protected access (WPA2)
- CCMP block cipher block chaining 
  - Created in 2004
  - CCMP security servies (AES protocol)

- Has a brute-force problem
  - PSK brute-force problem
 
# WPA 3
- GCMP block cipher mode
  - Galois/Counter mode protocol
  - A stronger envryption than WPA2
  - GCMP security services

# Simultaneous Authentication (SAE)
- WPA3 uses PSK authentication process
  - Includes mutual authenitcation
  - Creates a shared session key without sending that key across the network
  - No hashes, no brute force attacks

- In sae, everyone uses a different session key

# Wireless authentication methods
- Shared password / pre-shared key (PSK)
  - Personal 
  - WPA3 - PSK
- Centralized authentication (802.1X)
  - Enterpise 
  - WPA3- Enterpise (802.1X)

# Captive portal
- Authentication to a network
  - Common on wireless networks

- Access table recognizes a lack of authetication
  - Username / password ex: Hotel 

# Using WPS
- Wi-Fi Protected Setup
- Used to be called Wi-Fi SImple Config

- Allows "easy" setup of a mobile device

# The WPS hack
- WPS has a design flaw
  - PIN is an eight-digit number, only 10,000,000 combinations
  - Easy to hack 

# Extensible Authentication Protocl (EAP)
- EAP integrates with 802.1X
  - Prevents access to the network
