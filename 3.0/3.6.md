# HA across zones
- Availability zones
  - Isolated locations within a cloud region
  - AZ commonly spans across multiple regions

- Build applications to be highly available (HA)
  - Run as active/standby or active/active 

- Use load balancers to provides seamless HA

# Resource policies
- Identity and access management (IAM)
  - Who gets access 
  - What they get access to

- Map job functions to roles 
  - COmbine users into groups

- Provide access to cloud resources 

- Centralize user accounts 

# Secrets management
- API keys, passwords, certificates 
- This can quickly become overwhelming which is difficult to manage

- Authroize access to the secrets 
  - Limit access to the secrets 

# Integration and auditing
- Integrate security across multiple platforms 

- Consolidate log storage and reporting
  - Cloud-BAsed security information and Event Management (SIEM)

- Auditing
  - Validate security controls

# Cloud storage
- Data in on a public cloud
  - May not be public data

- Access can be limited
  - and protected

- Data my be required in different geographical locations
  - A backup is always required

- Availability is always important

# Permissions
- A significant cloud storage concern
  - One permission mistake can cause a data breack

- Public access
  - Should not usually be the default

- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
 - Bucket policies
 - Globally blocking public access
 - Don't put data in the cloud unless it needs to be there 

# Encryption
- Cloud data is more accessible than non-cloud data
- Server-side encryption
  - ENcrypt the data in the cloud
  - Data is encrypted when stored on disk 

- Client-side ecryption 
  - Data is already encrypted when it's sent to the cloud
  - Performed by the applications

# Replication
- Copy data from one place to another
  - Disaster recovery, high availability 

- Data analysis
  - Analystics big data analysis

- Backups; COnstant duplication of data 

# Cloud networks
- Connect cloud components 
  - Users communicate to the cloud
  - Over a VPN tunnel

- Cloud devices communicate between each other 

# Virtual networks
- A cloud contains virtual devices

- virtual switches, virtual routers 

# Public and private subnets
- Private cloud
  - All internal IP addresses
  - Connect to the private cloud over a VPN

- Public cloud
  - External IP addresses
  - Connect to the cloud from anywhere

- Hybrid cloud
  - Combine internal cloud resources with external 

# Segmentation
- THe cloud contains separate VPCs, Containers, and microservices

- Separation is a security opportunity

- Add security systems between application components 

# API inspection and integration
- Microservice architecture is the underlyng application change

- API calls can include risk
  - API monitoring 

# Compute cloud instances
- THe IaaS component for the cloud computing environment
  - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
  - Google Compute Engine (GCE)
  - Microsoft Azure VM 
- Manage computing resources

# Security groups
- A firewall for compute instances
- Layer 4 port number 
  - TCP or UDP 

- Layer 3 address
  - Individual addresses
  - CIDR block notation

# Dynamic resource allocation 
- Provision resources when they are needee
  - Based on demand
  - PRovisioned automatically 

- Scale up and down
  - Allocate compute resources 
  - Rapid elasticity 

# Instance awareness
- Granular security controls
- Define and set policies 

# Virtual private cloud endpoint
- VPC gateway endpoints
  - ALlow private cloud subnets
  - Keep private resources private
 
# Container Security 
- Containers have sinukar security concerns as any other application deployment method

- Use container-specific operating systens 
  - A minimalist OS designed for containers

- Group cotainer types on the same host 

# Cloud access security Broker (CASB)
- Clients are at work, data is in the cloud 

- How do you make your security policies work in the cloud?

- CASB works of multiple characteristics 
  - Visibility
  - Compliance
  - Threat prevention
  - Data security

# Application security
- Secure cloud-based applications
  - Complexity increases in the cloud

- Application misconfigurations
  - One of the most common sxecurity issuesx

- Authorization and access
  - Control should ne strong

# Next-Gen Secure Web Gateway (SWG)
- Protect users and devices 
  - Regardless of location and activity

- Go beyond URLs and GET request
  - Examine application API 

- Examine JSON strings and API request 

- Instance - aware security

# Firewalls in the cloud
- Control traffic flows in the cloud 
  - Inside the cloud and external 

- Cost
  - Relatively inexpensive compared to appliances 

- Segmentation 
  - Between microservices, VMs, or VPCs 
  
# Security controls
- Integrated and supported by the cloud provider
- Many configurations options

- Third-party solutions
  - Support across multiple cloud providers 
  - Single pane of glass
  - More extensive reporting
