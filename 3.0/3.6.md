# HA across zones
- Availability zones
  - Isolated locations within a cloud region
  - AZ commonly spans across multiple regions

- Build applications to be highly available (HA)
  - Run as active/standby or active/active 

- Use load balancers to provides seamless HA

# Resource policies
- Identity and access management (IAM)
  - Who gets access 
  - What they get access to

- Map job functions to roles 
  - COmbine users into groups

- Provide access to cloud resources 

- Centralize user accounts 

# Secrets management
- API keys, passwords, certificates 
- This can quickly become overwhelming which is difficult to manage

- Authroize access to the secrets 
  - Limit access to the secrets 

# Integration and auditing
- Integrate security across multiple platforms 

- Consolidate log storage and reporting
  - Cloud-BAsed security information and Event Management (SIEM)

- Auditing
  - Validate security controls

# Cloud storage
- Data in on a public cloud
  - May not be public data

- Access can be limited
  - and protected

- Data my be required in different geographical locations
  - A backup is always required

- Availability is always important

# Permissions
- A significant cloud storage concern
  - One permission mistake can cause a data breack

- Public access
  - Should not usually be the default

- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
 - Bucket policies
 - Globally blocking public access
 - Don't put data in the cloud unless it needs to be there 

# Encryption
- Cloud data is more accessible than non-cloud data
- Server-side encryption
  - ENcrypt the data in the cloud
  - Data is encrypted when stored on disk 

- Client-side ecryption 
  - Data is already encrypted when it's sent to the cloud
  - Performed by the applications

# Replication
- Copy data from one place to another
  - Disaster recovery, high availability 

- Data analysis
  - Analystics big data analysis

- Backups; COnstant duplication of data
