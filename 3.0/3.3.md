# Load balancing 
- A type of switch or router that distributes client requests between different resources, such as communications links or similarly-configured servers. This provides fault tolerance and improves throughput.

- Active/Passive
  - If a server gets shut down, it can relay information to another one

# Scheduling
- The scheduling algorithm is the code and metrics that determine which node is selected for processing each incoming request.
  - Robin, Which is picking up the next node
  - Another method is picking up the node with the least load

# Persistance 
- In load balancing, the configuration option that enables a client to maintain a connection with a load-balanced server over the duration of the session. Also referred to as sticky sessions.
  - Works by setting a cookie
  - The browser has to accept the cookie

# Network Segmentation
- A portion of a network where all attached hosts can communicate freely with one another 

# Intranet (private network)
- A private network that is only accessible by the ogranizations own personal
  - a network of trusted hosts owned and controlled by the organization. 

# Extranet
- A network of semi-trusted hosts, typically businesss partners, suppliers, or customers

# Virtual local area network (VLAN)
- Logically separate network, created by using switching tech. Even though hots on two VLANs may be physically connected to the same cabling, local traffic is isolated to each VLAN

# demilitarized zones (DMZ)
- A segment isolated from the rest of a pirvate network by one or more firewalls that accepts connection from the internet over designated ports
  - perimeter or edge network.

# East-West Traffic
- Design paradigm accounting for the fact that data center traffic between servers is grater than that passing in and out 

# Zero Trust
- Security design paradigm where any request must be authenticated before being allowed.
  - Continuous authentication and conditional access to mitigate privilege escalation and compromise by threat actors.

# Virtual private network
- A secure tunnel created between two endpoints connected via an unsecure network
  - Clients connect to a VPN gateway on a private network

# Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)
- VPN protocol for tunneling PPP sessions across a variety of network protocols such as IP, Frame Relay, or ATM
  1. The client and VPN gateway set up a secure IPSec channel over the Internet, using either a pre-shared key or certificates for IKE.
  2. The VPN gateway uses L2TP to set up a tunnel to exchange local network data encapsulated as Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) frames. This double encapsulation of traffic is the main drawback, as it adds overhead.
  3. The user authenticates over the PPP session using EAP or CHAP.

# Always on VPN
- Always-on VPN means that the computer establishes the VPN whenever an internet connection over a trusted network is detected, using the server cached credentials to authenticate. 

# Split tunnel 
- VPN configuration where only traffic for the private network is routed via the VPN gateway

# Full tunnel 
- VPN configuration where all traffic is routed via the VPN gateway
  - Better security, the address translates to DNS operations

# IPsec 
= Tunnel mode
  - THis is used to communicate between VPN gateways across an unsecure network.

# Network access control (NAC)
- A general term for the collected protocols, policies, and hardware that authenticate and authroize access to a network on the device
  - Extend the scope of authentication to allow administrators to devise policies or profile describing a minimum security configuration 

- Agents
  - Software and hardware agents
  - Deep inspection, not just of packets, but of the entire end point

# MAC filtering 
- Apply an access control list to a switch or access point so that only clients with approved MAC addresses can connect to it
  - Having a list of hardware that can connect to a port

# Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) snooping 
- A configuration option that enables a switch to inspect a DHCP traffic to prevent MAC spoofing
  - inspects traffic arriving on access ports 

# Broadcast Storm Prevention
- Traffic that is recirculated and amplified by loops in a switching topology, causing network slowdowns and crashing switches 

# Bridge Protocol Data unit (BPDU) guard 
- Switch port security feature that disables the port if is receives BPDU notifications related to spanning tree. 

# Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)
- Spanning tree is means for the bridges to organize themselves into a hierarchy and prevent loops from forming. 

# Domain name resolution
- DNS has no security in the orginal design
  - Validate DNS responses
  - Public key crpytography

- Stop users from dangerous websites
  - Sinkhole address

# Out-of-band management
- The network isnt available
