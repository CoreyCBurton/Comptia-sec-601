# Load balancing 
- A type of switch or router that distributes client requests between different resources, such as communications links or similarly-configured servers. This provides fault tolerance and improves throughput.

- Active/Passive
  - If a server gets shut down, it can relay information to another one

# Scheduling
- The scheduling algorithm is the code and metrics that determine which node is selected for processing each incoming request.
  - Robin, Which is picking up the next node
  - Another method is picking up the node with the least load

# Persistance 
- In load balancing, the configuration option that enables a client to maintain a connection with a load-balanced server over the duration of the session. Also referred to as sticky sessions.

# Network Segmentation
- A portion of a network where all attached hosts can communicate freely with one another 

# Intranet (private network)
- A private network that is only accessible by the ogranizations own personal
  - a network of trusted hosts owned and controlled by the organization. 

# Extranet
- A network of semi-trusted hosts, typically businesss partners, suppliers, or customers

# Virtual local area network (VLAN)
- Logically separate network, created by using switching tech. Even though hots on two VLANs may be physically connected to the same cabling, local traffic is isolated to each VLAN

# demilitarized zones (DMZ)
- A segment isolated from the rest of a pirvate network by one or more firewalls that accepts connection from the internet over designated ports
  - perimeter or edge network.

# East-West Traffic
- Design paradigm accounting for the fact that data center traffic between servers is grater than that passing in and out 

# Zero Trust
- Security design paradigm where any request must be authenticated before being allowed.
  - Continuous authentication and conditional access to mitigate privilege escalation and compromise by threat actors.
