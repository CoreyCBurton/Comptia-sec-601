# Point-to-point
- One-to-one connection
  - Two devices are communicating
- Wi-Fi repeaters
  - Extend the length of an existing network

# Point-to-Multipoint
- One of the most popular communication methods today
- Does not imply full connectivity between nodes 

# Cellular networks 
- Mobile devices 
- Separate land into cells 

- Security concerns
  - Traffic monitoring
  - Location tracking
  - Worldwide access to a mobile device

# Wi-Fi
- Local network access
  - LOcal security problems
  - Same security concerns as other Wi-Fi devices
  - Data capture; Encrypt your data!
  - on path attacks

# Bluetooth
- High speed communication over short distances 
  - PAN (Personal Area Network)
  - Connects mobile devices

# RFID (Radio-Frequency id)
- Its everywhere
  - Access badges
  - Iventory
  - Pet/Animal 
  
- Uses Radar technology
  - Radio energy transmitted to the tag
  - RF powers the tag, ID is transmitted back

# Near field communication (NFC)
- Two-way wireless communication
  - Builds on RFID

- Payment systems 

- Bootstrap for other wireless 

- Security concerns
  - Remote capture
  - Frequency jamming
  - Relay/replay attack

# IR(Infrared)
- Included on many smartphones, Tablets, and smartwatches
- Control your entertainment center
- FIle transfers are possible
- OTher phonces can be used to control IR

# Global positioning System (GPS)
- Created by the U.S. department of defense
- Precise navigation
- Determines the location on timing differences
- Mobile device location services and geotracking

# Mobile Device Management (MDM)
- Manage company-owned and user-owned devices
  - BYOD - Bring your own device

- Centralized management of the mobile devices 

- Set policies on apps, data,camera

- Manage access control
  - Force screen locks and PINs on these devices

# Application management
- Managing mobile apss are a challenge
  - Mobile devices install apps constantly

- Not alot application are secure
  - Some are malicious

- Manage application use through allow lists

# Content management
- Mobile Content Management (MCM)
  - Secure access to data
  - Protect data from outsiders

- FIle sharing and viewing
  - On-site content (Microsoft sharepoint, file servers)
  - Data sent from the mobile device 
  - DLP (Data loss prevention)
  - Stored in encrypted fourm
  
# Remote Wipe
- Remove all the data from your mobile device
  - Even if you have no idea where it is
  - Often managed from the mdm

- Connect and wipte from the web
- Always have a backup

# Geolocation
- Precise tracking details
  - Tracks within feet

- Can be used for good (or bad)
  - You can disable the geolocation functionality

# Geofencing
- Some MDMs allow for geofencing
  - Restrict or allow features when the device is in a particular area

- Cameras 
  - The camera might only work when outside the office
  - Authentication

# Screenlock
- All mobiles devices can be locked
  - Keep people out of your data

- Simple passcode or strong passcode
  - Numbers vs. Alphanumeric

- Fail to many times?
  - Erase the phone

# Push notification services
- Information appears on the mobile device screen

- No user intervention
  - Receive notification from on app to another

- Control displayed notification can be managed forom the MDM

# Passwords and PINs
- The universal help desk call

- Mobile devicwes use multiple authenitcation methods
 - Password/passphrase

- Recovery process can be intitiatedc from the MDM

# Biometrics
- You are the authentication factor

- May not be the most secure 
  - Useful in some environments

- Availability is managed through MDM
  - Organization determines the security of the device

- Can be managed per-app
  - Some apps require additional biometric authentication

# Context-aware authentication
- Who needs 2FA
  - The attackers can get around anything

- Authentication can be contextual

- COmbines multiple context
  - IP address
  - GPS information
  - Bluetooth

# Containerization
- Difficult to separate personal from business
  - Especially when the device is BYOD

- Separate enterpsie and mobile apps

- Full device encrpytion
  - Scramble all of the data on the mobile device
  - Devices handle this in different ways
  
# MicroSD HSM
- Shrink the PCI Express Hardware Security Module
  - Now in a microSD card

- Provides securtiy services
  - Encryption

# Unified Endpoint Management (UEM)
- Manage mobile and non-mobile devices
  - An evolution of MDM

- End users have different types of devices.
  - Their use has blended together

- All of these devices can be used from anywhere 

# Mobile application Management (MAM)
- Provision, update, and remove apps
  - Keep everyone running at the correct version

- Create an enterprise app catalog
  - Users can choose and install apps they need

- Moniotr application use

#SEAndroid
- Security Enhancements for android
  - SELinux on the android OS

- A project from the US National Security Agency

- Addresses a broad scope of system security

- Protect privileged android systems daemons

# Third-party app stores
- Centralized app clearinghouses 

- Not all applications are secure

# Rooting/Jailbreaking
- Mobile devices are purpose-bulit systems

- Gaining access
  - Android - rooting
  - apple IOS - Jailbreaking

- Install customer firmware 

# Carrier unlocking
- Most phones are locked to a carrier 

# Firmware OTA updates
- The operating system of a mobile device is constantly changing
  - Similar to a desktop computer

- Updates are provided over the air (OTA)

- Security patches or entire operating system updates

# Camera use
- Caemras are conmtroversial, not always a good thing

- Camera use can be controlled by the MDM
