# Password keys
- Hardware-based authentication
  - Something you have
  
- Help prevent unauthorized logins and account take over 

- Doesnt replace other factors
  - Passwords are still important

# Password vaults
- Password managers 
  - All passwords are in one passwords
  - A database of credentials 

- Secure storage 
  - All credentials are encrypted 

- Create unique passwords
  - Passwords are not the same across sites 

# Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
- A specification for crpytographic functions 
  - HArdware to help with all of the encryption 

- Cryptographic processor 
  - Random number generator 

- Persistent memory 
  - Comes with unique keys burned in during production 

- Versatile memory 
  - Password protected 

# Hardware security module (HSM)
- High-end crpytographic hardware 
  - Plug-in card or separate hardware devices 
- Key backuo
  - Secured storage

- Cryptographic accelerators 

- Used in large environements 

# Knowledge-based authentication (KBA)
- Use personal knowledge as an authenitcation factor 
  - Something you know 

- Static KBA
  - Pre-configured shared secrets 
  - Often used with account recovery 
  - Example: what whas the make and model of the first car?

- Dynamic KBA 

# Gaining acess 
- An outside user tries to gain access to a firewall/vpn concentrator
  - The vpn and firewall sends information to the AAA server to see if it is valid
  - It is then sent on to the file server

# PAP 
- Password Authentication Protocol)
- A basic authentication method 
  - used in legacy operating systems

- PAP is in the clear 
  - Non-encrypted password exchange 

# CHAP
- Challenge-Handshake authentication protocol 
  - Encrypyed challenge sent over the network

- Three-way hand shale 
  - Server compares recieves hash 

# MS-CHAP 
- Microsoft implementation of CHAP 

- Used DES
  - Easy to brute force 
  - Do not use this
  - we use L2TP, IPSEC, 802.1X 

# RADIUS
- ( Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service)
- One of the more common AAA protocols 

- Centralize authentication for users 

# TACACS
- Terminal access Controller Access-control system
  - Remote authentication protocol 

- XTACACS 

- TACACS+ 

# Kerberos 
- Network authentication protocol 
 - Authenticate once, Trusted by the system 
 - No need to re-authenticate everything
