# Redundancy 
* Duplicate parts of a system, If a part fails, the redundant part can be used

* Maintain uptime, No software available

* No system failure 

# Geograpgical Dispersal
* BAd things can happen in a local area; Hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding

* Disperse technolofies to different geograpgies 

* Data centers might be part of normal operations

# Disk redundancy
* Multipath I/O (input/output)

* Raid ( Redundant Array of Independent Disks ) 

* Multiple drives create redundancy 

# Load balancing
* Some servers are active, others are on standby 

* If an active server fails, the passive server take its place

# NIC teaming
* Load Balancing / fail over (LBFO)

* Aggregate bandwidth, redundant paths 

* multiple network adapters, looks like a single adapter

* NICs talk to each other, Usually multicast instead of broadcast

# UPS
* Uninterruptible power supply; Short-term backup power 

* Blackouts, brownouts, surges

* UPS types; Offline/standby UPS, Line-interactive UPS, On-line double-conversion UPS

# Generators
* Long-term power backup; Full storage requirement, Power can entire building.

* It will take a few minutes to get the generator to get up to speed

# Dual power supplies
* Redundancy, Internal power supplies

* Each power supply can handle 100% of the load 

# Power disribution units (PDUs)
* Provide multiple power outlets, usually in a rack

* Often include monitoring and control 

# SAN replication
* Share data between different devices, if one device ffails, you can still work with the data

* Storage area network (SANs), Specialized high-performance network of storage devices

* SAN-to-SAN, duplicate data from on data center to another

* SAN snapshot, Create a stae of data based on a point in time

# VM replication
* Virtual machine redundancy, Maintain one VM, replicate to all others

* Consistent service offering 

* Recover from a replicated copy 

# On premises vs. cloud redundancy
* Speed, Local devices are connect over very fast network

* Cloud connection are almost always slower 

* Purchasing your own storage is an expensive capital investment 

* Local data is private, data stored in the cloud requires additional security controls
