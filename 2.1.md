# Configuration management 
* There are constant changes in the operating systems, patches, application updates, network modifications, etc. 

* Identify and document hardware and software settings 

* Documentation will be crucial 

# Diagrams 
* Network diagrams; Document the physical wire and device 

* Physical data center layout 

* Device diagrams; Cables

# Baseline configuration 
* The security of an application environment should be well defined; Firewall settings, patch levels, OS file versions

* Integrity measurements check for the secure baseline 

# Standard naming conventions 
* Create a standard; needs to be understood by everyone

* Devices; Asset tag names; computer names; serial numbers

* Networks; Port labeling 

* Domain configurations 

# IP schema 
* An ip address plan or model; Consistent addressing for network devices; Helps avoud duplicate IP addressing

* Locations; number of subnets, hosts per subnet

* IP ranges; different sites have a different subnet 

# Data Protecting 
* A primary job task; an organization is out of business without data

* Data is everywhere; Storage drive, network, or in a CPU

* Protecting the data; Encryption, security policies; Data permissions

# Data sovereignty
* Data that resides in a country is subject to laws of that country

* Laws may prohibit where data is stored. Data collected on EU citizens must be stored in the EU 

# Data masking
* Data obfuscation; Hide the original data

* Protects PII 

* May only be hidden from view

> EX: On a receipt, there is a credit card number with Xs to stop the viewer from seeing the whole number 

# Data encryption
* Encode information into unreadable data

* Confusion; The encrpyted data is drastically different than the plaintext 

> EX: Having the encrpytion longer than the text wrote

# Diffusion 
* Change one character of the input, and many characters change of the output. One character should change the cypher text

# Data at-rest
* The data is on a storage device; Hard drive, SSD, flash drive

* Encrupt the data; Whole disk encrpytion 

* Apply permissions 

# Data in-transit
* Data is transmitted in-motion

* Not much protection as it travels

* Network-based protection; Firewall IPS

* Provide transport encrpytion; TLS 

# Data in-use
* Data is actively processing in memory; System RAM, CPU 

* The data is almost always decrpyted 

* The attackers can pick the decrpyted information out of RAM

> EX: Target corp breach. Data was stolen from data in use at POS systems

# Tokenization
* Replace sensitive data with a non-sensitive placeholder

> EX: ssn 266-12-1112 but is 691-61-8539

* Common with credit cards processing; Replacing number and characters with another set. No encryption 

# Information RIghts Management (IRM)
* Control how data is used

* Restrict data access to unauthroized persons; Prevent copy and paste, control screenshots, manage printing, restrict editing

# Hardware security module (HSM)
* A physical device that are tamper proof that safeguards secret digital keys. 

* Used when implementing PKI or SSH to achieve a high degree of data protection

# Geographical considerations
* Legal implications; Business regulations vary between states.

* It is important to note that it is important that data is linked to geographical legally. 

* Offsite recovery and offsiteback is important,

# Response and recovery controls
* Incident response and recovery 

* Incident response plan should be established; Document is critical 

* Limit the impact of an attacker; Limit the data exfiltration and limit access to sensitive data 

# SSL/TLS inspection 
* Commonly used to examine outgoing SSL/TLS; Transport Layer Security is up to date. 

* SSL inspection relies on trust, SSL inspection allws you to be in the middle. 

* A browser doesn't trust a website unless a CA has signed the web server.

* Valiedates with DNS record, phone call, etc.

* The browser looks at the web certs to see if it matches then encrypts the information

# Hashing 
* Represnt data as a short string of text; A message digest 

* One-way trip; Impossible to recover the orginal message from the digest.

* Verify a download document that is the same as the orginal. You can verify the document on a website.

* Used as a digital signature

ex: SHA256 hash, 256 bits / 64 hexadecimal characters. 

# API considerations
* Application PRogramming Interface

* Secure and harden the login page; Secure and harden the login page

* On-path attack; Intercept and modify API messages, replay API commands; Inject data into on API message. 

* DDoS can cause an API to go down.

* WAF, Web Application Firewall 

# Site resiliency
* Recovery site is prepped

* A disaster is called, failover to the alternate processing site

* Revert back to the primary location. 

# Hot site
* An exact replica, Stocked with ahrdware, constantly updated

* Applications and software are constantly updates; AUtomated replication 

* Flip a switch and everything moves

# Cold site
* No hardware, empty building. No data

* No people

# Warm site
* Somewhere between hot and cold.

* Has racks and some equipment, Hardware is ready and waiting

# Honeypots
* Attract the bad guys, it traps them there

* The attacker is probably a machine; Makes an interesting recon

* Honeypots creates a virtual world

* Many different options; Kippo, Google Hack Honeypoy, Wordpot, etc.

# Honeyfiles and honeynets
* More than one honeypot 

* More than one source of information; Stop spammers'

* Example is passwords.txt; It is a bear trap not real

# Fake telemetry
* Machine learning, interpret big data to identify the invisible

* Train the machine with actual data

* Send the machine learning model with fake telemtry; Make malicious malwaork look good.

# DNS sinkhole
* A DNS that hands out incorect IP addresses 

* This can be bad, an attacker can redirect user to a malicious site

* This can be good, redirect kown malicious domains
