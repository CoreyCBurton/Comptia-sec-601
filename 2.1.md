# Configuration management 
* There are constant changes in the operating systems, patches, application updates, network modifications, etc. 

* Identify and document hardware and software settings 

* Documentation will be crucial 

# Diagrams 
* Network diagrams; Document the physical wire and device 

* Physical data center layout 

* Device diagrams; Cables

# Baseline configuration 
* The security of an application environment should be well defined; Firewall settings, patch levels, OS file versions

* Integrity measurements check for the secure baseline 

# Standard naming conventions 
* Create a standard; needs to be understood by everyone

* Devices; Asset tag names; computer names; serial numbers

* Networks; Port labeling 

* Domain configurations 

# IP schema 
* An ip address plan or model; Consistent addressing for network devices; Helps avoud duplicate IP addressing

* Locations; number of subnets, hosts per subnet

* IP ranges; different sites have a different subnet 

# Data Protecting 
* A primary job task; an organization is out of business without data

* Data is everywhere; Storage drive, network, or in a CPU

* Protecting the data; Encryption, security policies; Data permissions

# Data sovereignty
* Data that resides in a country is subject to laws of that country

* Laws may prohibit where data is stored. Data collected on EU citizens must be stored in the EU 

# Data masking
* Data obfuscation; Hide the original data

* Protects PII 

* May only be hidden from view

> EX: On a receipt, there is a credit card number with Xs to stop the viewer from seeing the whole number 

# Data encryption
* Encode information into unreadable data

* Confusion; The encrpyted data is drastically different than the plaintext 

> EX: Having the encrpytion longer than the text wrote

# Diffusion 
* Change one character of the input, and many characters change of the output. One character should change the cypher text

# Data at-rest
* The data is on a storage device; Hard drive, SSD, flash drive

* Encrupt the data; Whole disk encrpytion 

* Apply permissions 

# Data in-transit
* Data is transmitted in-motion

* Not much protection as it travels

* Network-based protection; Firewall IPS

* Provide transport encrpytion; TLS 

# Data in-use
* Data is actively processing in memory; System RAM, CPU 

* The data is almost always decrpyted 

* The attackers can pick the decrpyted information out of RAM

> EX: Target corp breach. Data was stolen from data in use at POS systems

# Tokenization
* Replace sensitive data with a non-sensitive placeholder

> EX: ssn 266-12-1112 but is 691-61-8539

* Common with credit cards processing; Replacing number and characters with another set. No encryption 

# Information RIghts Management (IRM)
* Control how data is used

* Restrict data access to unauthroized persons; Prevent copy and paste, control screenshots, manage printing, restrict editing
