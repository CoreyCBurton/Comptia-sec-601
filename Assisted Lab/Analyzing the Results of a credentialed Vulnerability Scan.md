# Credentiale vs Non-Credential
- Credentialed vs non-credentialed scans.
  - Non-credentialed scans collect publicly-available information. Because credentialed scans rely on administrative access to resources, they can probe deeper to detect vulnerabilities.

# Configure target
- Configuration > Targets

- Configuration is below
