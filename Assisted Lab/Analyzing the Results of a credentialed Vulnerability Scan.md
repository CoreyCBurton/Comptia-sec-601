# Credentiale vs Non-Credential
- Non-credentialedscans.
  - Non-credentialed scans collect publicly-available information.  
- Credentialed 
  - Credentialed scans rely on administrative access to resources, they can probe deeper to detect vulnerabilities.

# Configure target
- The path is Configuration > Targets
   -  This GUI sets up what server we would like to scan
   - Configuration is below
