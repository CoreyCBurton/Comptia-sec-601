# Identify vulnerability
- The scanner looks for everthing
  - The signatures are the key 

- The vulnerabilites can be cross-referenced online
  - National Vulnerability Database - nvd.nist.gov
  - Microsoft Security Bulletins 

- Some vulnerabilites cannot be definitively identified 

# Vulnerability scan results 
- Lack of security controls
  - No firewall
  - No anti-virus
  - No anti-spyware

- Misconfigurations
  - Open shares
  - Guest access

- Real vulnerabilites 
  - Especially newer ones 

# Dealing with false postivies 
- False postives 
  - A vulnerability is identified that doesn't really exist

- This is different than a low-severity vulnerability 

- False negatives
  - A vulnerability exist, it wasent detected 

- Update the latest signatures to get rid of false signature 

# SIEM
- Security infromation and event management 
  - Logging of security events and information

- Security alerts
  - Real-time information

- Log aggreagation and long-term storage

- Data correlation
  - Link diverse types

- Forensic analysis

# Getting the data
- Sensors and logs
  - Operating systems
  - Infrastrucutre devices
  - NetFLow sensors
- Sensitivity settings
  - Easy to be overwhelmed with data
  - Infromational, Warning, Urgent 

# Viewing the data
- Trends
  - Identify changes over time
  - Easily view constant attack machines

- Alerts 
  - IDentify a security event
  - View raw data

- Correlation 
  - View data in different ways

# Network log files
- Switches, routers,access points, VPN concentrators

- Network changes
  - Routing updates
  - Authentication issues
  - NEtwork security issues

# System log files
- Operating system information
  - Extensive logs
  - File system information
  - Authentication details

- Can also include security events
  - Brute force, file changes

- MAy require filtering

# Application log files 
- Specific to the application 
  - Information varies widely 

- Windows 
  - Event viewer / application log

- Linux / macOS
  - Var/log

- Parse the log details on the SIEM
  - FIler out unneeded information
 
 # Security log files
 - Detailed security-related information
   - Block and allowed traffic
   - Exploit attempts
   - blocked URL categories
