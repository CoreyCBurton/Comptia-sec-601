# Security incidents
- User clocks an email attachment and executes malware
  - Malware then communicates with external servers

- DDoS
  - Botnet attack

- Confidential information is stolen 
  - Thief wants money or it goes public 

# Roles and responsibiliti
- Incident response team
  - Specialized group, trained and tested

- IT security management 
  - Corporate support

- Compliance officers 

# NIST SP8--=61
- National INstitute of standards and technologu

- The incident response lifecycle
  - Preparation
  - Deteection and analysis
  - Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
  - Post-incident activity 

# Preparing for an incident 
- Communication methods
  - Phones and contact infromation 

- Incident handling hardware and software
  - Laptops, removable media, forensic sofftware, digital caemras. etc.

- Incident analysis respirces

- Incident mitigation software
  - Clean OS and application images

# The challenge of detection
- Many different levels of detail, different levels of perception

- A large amount of "volume"
  - Attacks are incoming all the time
  - How do you identify the legitmiate threats 
 
- Incidents are almost always complex 

# Incident precursors
- An incident might occur in the future 

- Web server log 
  - VUlnerability scanner in use

- Exploit announcement 

- Direct threats

# Incident indicators
- An attack is underway
  - An exploit is successful

- Buffer overflow attempt
  - Identified by an intrusion detection/prevention system

- Host-based monitor detects 

- Network traffic flows deviate from the norm

# Isolation and containment
- Generally a bad idea to let things run their course

- Sandboxses
  - Isolated operating system
  - Run malware and analyze the results

- Isolation can be sometimes be problematic 

# Recovery after an incident
- Get things back to normal
  - Remove the bad, keep the good

- Eradicate the bug
  - Remove malware
  - Disable breached user accounts
  - Fix vulnerabilities 

- Recover the system
  - Restore from backups
  - Replace compremoised files
  - Tighten down the perimeter

# Reconstitution
- A phased approach 

- Recovery may take months

- The plan should be efficient
  - Start with quick, high-value security changes 

- LAter phases invlove heavy lifting 

# Lessons learned
- Learn and improve 
  - No system is perfect

- Post-incident meeting

- Don't wait too long

# Answer the tough questions
- What happened

- How did your incident plans work?

- What would you do next time? 

# Exercise
- Test yourselves before an acutal event
  - Scheduled update sessions (annual,semi-annual,etc.)
- Use well-defined rules of engagement
  - Do not touch the production systems
- Very specific scenario 
  - Limited time to run the event

- Evalute the response 

# Tabletop exercises
- Performing a full-scale disaster drill can be costly

- Many of the logistics can be determined through analysis

- Get key players together for a tabletop exercise 

# Walkthrough
- Include responders
  - A step beyond a tabletop exercise

- Test processes and procedures before an event

- Identifies actual faults or missing steps 

# Simulation
- Test with a simulated event
  - Phishing attack, password request, data breaches

- Going phishing 
  - Create a phishing email attack
  - Send to your actual user community 

- Test internal security

- Test the users
  - Who clicked

# Stakeholder management
- Keeping a good ongoing relationship with customer of IT
  - These can be internal or external 

- Most of this happens prior to an incident
  - Ongoing communication and meetings

- Continues after the incident

# Communication plan
- Get your contact list together 
  - There are a lot of people in the loop

- Corporate / organization
  - CIO / Head of information securtiy

- Internal non-IT

- External contacts
  - System owner, law enforcement

# Disaster recovery plan
- If a disaster happens, IT should be ready 

- Disasters are many and varied
  - Natural disasters
  - Technologu or system failures
  - human-created disasters

- A comprehensive plan 

# Continuity of operations planning (COOP)
- Not evertthing goes according to plan
- We rely on our computer systems
- There needs to be an alternative

# Incident response team
- Recieves, reviews and responds

- Determine what type of events requires a response
  - A virus infection? Ransomware? DDoS

- May or may not be apart of the organizational structure

- Focuses on incdient handling
  - Incident response
  - Incident analysis 
  - Incident reporting

# Retention policies
- Backup your data
  - How mych and where
  - copies, versions, lifecycle of data 

- Regulatroy compliance
  - A certian amount of data backup may be required

- Operatinal needs
  - Accidental deletion
  - Disaster recovery

- Differentiate by type and application
  - Recover the data you need when you need it
