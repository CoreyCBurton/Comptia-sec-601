# Embedded systems
* Hardware and software designed for a specific function

* Is built with only this task in mind, can be optimized for size and/or cost

> EX: Common light controllers, digital watches 

# SoC (System on a chip)
* Multiple components running on a single chip

* Small form-factor, extgernal interface support, Cache memory, flash memory, low power concumption. Example is a raspberry pi.

# Field-programmable gate array (FPGA)
* An intergrated circut that can be configured after manufacturing

* A problem doesn't require a hardware replacement, Reporgram the FPGA. 

* Common in infrastructure, Firewall logic, routers. 

# SCADA / ICS
* Supervisory Control and Data Acquistion System, Large-scale, multi-site industrial control systems

* Pc manages equipment

* Distributed control systems

* Requires extensive segmentation, No access from the outside 

# IoT
* Internet of Things, Heating and cooling. Sensors

* Smart devices, Home automation, video doorbells

* Wearable technology, Watches, health monitors

* Facility automation 

* Weak defualts 

* Not made for security. IoT devices can be seprate from home network just incase someone gains access 

# Specialized
* Medical devices, Heart monitor, insulin pumps. 

* Vehicles, internal network is often accessible from mobile networks

* Aircraft, DoS could damage the aircraft

* Smart meters, Measure power and water usage 

# VoIP
* Voice over internet protocol 

* A relatively complex embedded system, Can be relatively important

* Each device is a computer, Seprate boot

# HVAC 
* HEating Ventilation, and Conditioning

* A complex science, Not something you cna properly design

* Pc manages equipment, Security is not in mind.

# Drones
* FLying vechile, no pilot on board

* May be manually controlled, Often with some autonomy 

* Extensive commercial and non-commerical use 

# Multifunction devices (MFD)
* No longer a simple printer, Very sophisticated firmware

* Some images are storec locally on the device

* Logs  are stored on the device

# RTOS ( Real-time operating System)
* An operating system with a dtereministic processing schdule

* Industrial equipment, automobiles 

* Miliatray enviroments

* Extremely sensitive to security issues

# Surveillance systems
* Video/audio surveillance, embedded system are in the cameras

* Secure the security system, Do support firmware upgrades 

# 5g
* 5 generation cellular networking, Launched worldwide 2020

* Significant performance imporvements, High frequencues

* Significant IoT impact, Bandwidth becomes leess of a constrant 

# Subscriber identity module (SIM)
* A universal integreated circut 

* Used to provide information to a cellualr network provider

* contains mobile details, IMSI ( International mobile subscriber identity)

# Narrowband
* Communicate analog signals over a narrow range of frequencies, Over a long range distance

* Many IoT (internet of things) communicate 

# Baseband
* Generally a singe cable with a digital signal 

* THe communication signal used all the bandwidth

* Bidirectional communication, using the same wire/fiber

* Ethernet standard 

# Zigbee 
* Internet of thingsx networking, Open standard

* Alternative to WiFi and Bluetooth, Longer distances than bluetooth

* Mesh netowrk of all zigbee devices in your home, Tell Amazon Echo to lock the door

# Uses the ISM band
* Industrial Scientific, and Medical
