# Zero day
- A vulnerability in software that is unpatched by the developer or an attack that exploits such a vulnerability
  - A vulnerability that has been discovered but the company does not know about 
  - These can be extremely destructive 
 
# Open Permissions
- Users have to many Permissions towards sensitive data
  - Open door where the hacker can just walk on in

- Permissions can be complex and it is easy to make mistakes

- **Example** - 14 million Verizon records exposed; Third-party left an Amazon S3 dta repository open

# Unsecure root accounts
- Root is easy to access which gives the user privileges to do what they want 
  - It is the default admin account 
  - Some Root passwords can be weak 

# Erros
- Errors give too much informtion to the hacker 
  - Errors can give service type, version information, debug data

- **Example** -Patreon was compromised; debugger to help monitor and troubleshoot website issues

# Weak encrpytion
- Easy to crack hashes can lead to information being stolen
  - Encrpytion protocol (AES,3DES)

- ngth of encrpytion is important and make sure wireless encryption is used

# Insecure protocols
- Having outdated protocols can lead to vulnerabilities in the network 
  - Some protocols aren't encrypted 

- Verify a packet caputre to make sure it is encrypted is a way to see if you have a great protocol. 

# Default settings
- Default settings make it easy for the hacker to get in. Default passwords is a huge vulnerability.

- **Example** Mirai botnet takes advantage of default configurations

# Open ports and servies
- Ports that accept packets is an open port 
  - Some open ports can be misconfigured, unpatched, and vulnerable to exploits 

- Make sure firewalls are in place 

# Third-party risks
- I.T security doesn't change because it's a third-party
  - Always plan for the worst; Human error is still a big issue

# System intergration
- Professional installation and maintenance 
  - Can be on-site with physica or virtual access 

- Less security on the inside; Port scanners and traffic captures
  - Can run software on the internet network

# Lack of vendor support
- Security requires diligence, it takes the vendor some time to patch a vulnerability. 
  - Vendors are the only ones who can fix the products 

- **Example** Trane Comfortlink 2 thermostats: there were three vulnerabilites in april 2014. The patches were then released on April 2015

# Supply chain
- You cant always control security at a third-party location 
  - Always maintain local security control

- Hardware and software from a vendor can contain malware 
  - Counterfeit hardware is out there

# Outsourced code deveoplment 
- Access the code base which can lead to security issues
  - Cloud-base access 

- Verify security to other systems
  - Test the code security; check for backdoors 

# Data storage
- Consider the type of data; Contact the type of data

- Storage at a third=party location needs encryption
  - Check the input and output

# Improper or weak patch management 
- The update server determines when you patch
  - Test all your apps, then deploy

# Firmware 
*  The BIOS of the device

# Operating system
- Monthly and on-demand patches can secure the operating system

# Applications 
- Provided by the manufacturer as-needed

- **Example** Equifax had a data break 147.9 million and many more. Apache Struts, a patch that was idenitifed on March 7, 2017. Wasent patched till July 30th

# Legacy platforms
- Some devices remain installed for a long time
 - Legaco devices with older operating systems, applications, middleware may have vulnerabilites

- May be running end-of-life software 

# Impacts
- Malicious cyber activity cost between 57 billion and 109 billion in 2016 
  - More than just finances, The company reputation is also damaged

# Data loss
- Vulnerability unsecured data bases
  - no password or default password

- internet facing databases are being deleted
  - Thousands of databases are missing

- **Example** Hacker Overwrites data with the word "meow";  no message or motive

# Identity theft
- Hackers target companies that have personal information
  - Equifax had data stolen in July 2017

# Financial Loss
- Bank of Bangladesh; Society for Worldwide interbank 
  - Attackers set secure messages to transfer nearly one billion dollars 

# Reputation impacts
- Getting hacked isn't a great look

- **Example** October 2016 - uber breach 25.6 million names, email addresses, and mobile phone numbers; They paid 148 million in fines

# Availability loss
- Outages and downtown
  - Ransomware can lock your files and down your system
