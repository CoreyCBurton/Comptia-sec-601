# Threat hunting
* A constant game of Cat and Mouse

* Strategies are constantly changing; Firewalls get stronger 

* Intelligence dta is reactive; you cant see the attack until it happens 

* Speed up reaction time

# Intelligence fusion
* An overwhelming amount of security data

* Many data types 

* separate teams such as Security operations, Security intelligence, threat response

# Threat feeds 
* Collect the data; logs and sensors, network information, internet events, intrusion detection 

* Add external sources; Threat feeds, government alerts, and social media 

# Maneuver 
* Firewall rule, block an IP address, delete malicious software 

* automate maneuvers; the computer reacts instantly 

* combine with fused intelligence; ongoing cmbat from many fronts 

# Vulnerability scanning
* Usually minimally invasive; Unlike a penetration test

* Port scan; poke around and see what's open 

* Identify systems; test from the inside and out

* Gather as much information as possible

# Non-intrusive scans 
* Gathering information, dont try to exploit a vulnerability

# Intrusive scans
* Find the vulnerability to see if it works 

# Non-credential scan
* The scanner can't login to the remote device 

# Credentialed scan
* You are a normal user, emulates an insider attack

# Application scans 
* Desktop, mobile apps

# Web applications
* Software on a web server  

# Network scans 
* Misconfigured firewalls, open ports, and vulnerable devices

# Vulnerability research
* National Vulnerability Database

* Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures shows vulnerabilties 

* Microsoft Security Bulletins 

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System 
* Scores vulnerability from 0 to 10 

* The scoring standards do change over time

# False positive
* A vulnerability does not really exist after scan

* It is different than a low-severity vulnerability

# False negative
* The vulnerability exists, you just couldnt detect it 

# Security information and Event Management 
* Logging of security events and information

* Log collection of security alerts

* Log aggregation and long-term storage

* Data correlation 

* Forensic analysis

# Syslog 
* Standard for message logging; Diverse system, consolidated log

* Usually a central log collector

* Requires alot of disk space

# SIEM data
* Data inputs; VON connections, firewall session logs, denied outbound traffic flows; Network utilizations

* Packet capture

# Security moniotring 
* Constant information flow 

* Track important statistics

* Send alerts when problems are found 

# Security reports and analyzing the data 
* Over a long period of time, there are security reports

* Big data analytics; Identify patterns 

* User and entity behavior analytics (UEBA)

* Sentiment analysis; public discourse correlates to real-world behavior 

# Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) 
* Automate routine, tedious, and time intensive activities

* Orchestration; connect many different tools together, firewalls, account management, email filters

* Automation is important because it is faster than humans
