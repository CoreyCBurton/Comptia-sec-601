#  Threat Actors
- The entity responsible for an even that has an impact on safety on another entity 
  - Broad scope of actors 

# Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) 
- Attackers are in the network and undetected
  - on a FireEye report, 71 days in america, 177 days in EMEA, and 204 days in APAC before they are detected

- Insiders
- A type of threat actor who is assigned privileges on a system that cause an intentional or unintentional incident
  - more than just passwords on sticky notes

- Attacks can be directed at vulnerable system but he know what to hit 
  - Eats away from the inside, they know everything

# Nation state 
- National security; always an external entity

- **Example** - Highest sophistication; Military, utilities; Stuxnet worm 

# Hacktivist
- A hacker with a purpose; social exchange or political agenda; often external
  - Funds are limited which is a disadvantage

# Script Kiddie
- Runs pre-made scripts without any knowledge of whats happening
  - Can be internal or external 
  - Not very sophisticated 

# Criminal syndicates
- professional criminals That do professional crimes
  - Most always external
  - very sophisticated
  - Crime that is organized 

# Expert with technology
- **White Hat** 
    - Authorized; ethical hacker with good intentions 

- **Black Hat** 
    - Unauthorized; Malicous 

- **Gray Hat** 
    - Semi-authorized; finds a vulnerability but doesnt use it 

# Shadow IT
- Computer hardware, software, or services used on a private network without the authorization from the system owner
  - Going Rouge; working around the internal IT organization 

# Competitors
- Many different motivations, THe competitors want an edge over their competitor 
  - High level of sophistication

- **Example** - Has many different intents; Shut down your computer, steal customers lists, corrupt manufacturing databases

# Vectors 
- **Attack vectors**
    - A method used by the attacker which gains them unauthorized access to a system 

- A lot of works and time goes into finding vulnerabilities in those vectors 

# Direct access
- Physical access to a system is significant 

- Modifty the operating system; reset the admin password a few times 
  - Attach a keylogger to collect username and passwords 

# Wireless
- Default login credentials; modify the access point 

- Rouge access point; A less-secure entry point to the network

- Evil twin; emulates the authentication details; man in the middle attack 

# Email 
- Everyone has an email account, It is attractive to hackers
  - Phishing attacks 
  - Social engineering attacks 
  - Deliver malware to the user

# Supply chain 
- Tamper with the underlying infrastructure, There are layers to operations
  - Target was affected by a supply chain attack
  - Malware can modifty the manufacturing process 

- **Examples** - Counterfeit networking equipment; install backdoor 

# Social media 
- Attackers thank you for putting personal information online
  - User profiling; Where you were born; what is the name of your school mascot as a security question

- Hackers can pose as Fake friends who try to get additional information

# Removable media attack vectros
- Get around the firewall by usb 
  - Malicious software on USB flash drives; infect air gapped networks 
  - USB devices can act as keyboards

# Cloud
- Public-facing applications and services
  - Security misconfigurations; Data permissions and public data stores
  - Brute force attacks 
  - Orchestration attakcs

# Threat intelligence
- Research the threats
  - Data is everywhere 
  - Make decisions based on what the hackers have researched
  - Used by researchers 

# Open-source intelligence (OSINT)

- Open source; Publicly available sources
  - Internet; Discussion groups, social meda
  - Government data
  - Commercial data 

# Closed/propreitary intelligence
- Someone else has already compiled the threat information
  - Threat intelligence services 
  - Constant threat monitoring

# Vulnerability database
- Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE); A community managed list of vulnerailities; sponsored by the U.S department of homeland Security 
  - Researches find vulnerabilities
  - U.S. National Vulnerbility Database

# Public/Private information centers 
- Public threat intelligence
  - often classified information

- Private threat intelligence
   - private companies have resources

- Need to share critical security details

- Cyber threat Alliance (CTA)

# Automate indicator sharing (ALS)
- Intelligence indusrty needs a standard way to share important threats

- Structured threat information eXpression (STIX)
  - describes cyber threat information

# Dark Web
- Overlay networks that use the internet; Requires specific software such as Tor

- **Examples** Hacking groups and services; Tools and techniques; credit card sales; accounts and passwords 

# Indicator of compromise (IOC)
- A sign that an asset or network has been attacked or is currently under attack
  - Unusual amount of network activity
  - Change to file hash values
  - Changes to DNS data
  - Uncommon login patterns
  - Spikes of read requests to certain files
  
 # Structures Threat Information eXpression (STIX)
 - A framework for analyzing cybersecurity incidents
   - Allows to see attacks in a timely manner 
   -  Threat analysis, automated threat exchange, automated detection

# Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information (TAXII)
- A protocol for supply codified information to automate incident detection and analysis 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81980702/120111404-71b54800-c137-11eb-8c8e-f4224020e257.png)

# Predictive analytics
- Analyze large amounts of data very quickly 
  - Find suspicious patterns 
  - Identify behaviors; DNS queries, traffic patterns, location data
  - Creates a forceast for potential attacks 

# Threat Maps
- Animated map showing threat sources in near real-time

# File/core repositories
- Github
- Public code repositories
- Attackers are always looking for this code 

- Threat research 
- Know your enemy
  - A never ending process and you cant rely on a single source 

# Vendor website
- Vendors and manufactourers; they wrote the software
  - They know when problems are accounced
  - They react when surprises happen; Knows zero days

# Vulnerability feeds
- Automated vulnerability notifications

- Third-party feeds 

- Roll-up to a vulnerability management system 

# Conferences
- Watch and learn 

- Researchers; new DDoS methods

- Stories from the trenches

- Building relationships 

# Acadenuc journals 
- Research from academic professionals 
  - Evaluations of exisitng security 
  - Detailed post mortem
  - Extremely detailed

# Request for comments
- Published by the internet Society 

- Not all RFCs are standard documents 

# Local indusrty groups
- A gethering of local peers
  - Associations 
  - Industry user groups 

# Social media 
- Haking group conversations
  - Honeypot monitoring on twitter

- **Examples** - keyword monitoring; CVE, Bugbounty, 0-day 

# Threat feeds
- Monitor threat accouncements 
  - many sources on information 

# TTP
- Tactics, Techniques, and procedures
  - Search through data and networks
  - Different types of TTP
  - Shows how hackers are doing it
