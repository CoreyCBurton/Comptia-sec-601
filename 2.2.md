# Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
- A computing method that uses the cloud to provide any or all infrastrucutre needs.
  - IT resourcess such as servers, load balancers, are provided in the cloud.

- You are stil responsible for the management of the security.
 - Your data is out there, more within your control. You control the operating system 

- Web server providers
  - Microsoft Azure and AWS

# Software as a service (SaaS)
- A computing method that uses the cloud to provide application services to its users. 
  - On-demand software - no local installation
  - Virtual infrastructure allows developers to provision services
  - A complete application offering; No development work required

# Platform as a service (PaaS)
- A computing method that uses the cloud to provide any platform-type services
  - No servers, no software, no maintenance team, no HVAC 

- You dont have direct control of the data, people. or infrastructure

- **Example** Salesforce.com

# Anything as a service (XaaS)
- A broad description of all cloud models

- Services delivered over the internet
  - FLexible consumption model 

- IT becomes more of an operating model 

# Cloud service providers 
- Provide cloud servies 
  - SaaS
  - PaaS
  - LaaS 

- Charge a flat fee or based on use 

- You still manage your processes; Internal staff, Development team, Operational support

# Managed service providers (MSP)
- A cloud service provider

- Not all cloud service providers are MSPs

- MSP support is in charge of 
  - Network connectivity management
  - Backups and disaster recovery  

- Manage Security Service Provider ( MSSP )
- FIrewall management
- patch management
- security audits

# On-premises 
- Your applicationms are on local hardware
  - Your servers are in your data center in your building

# Off-premises / hosted
- Your server not in your building
  - They may not even be running your hardware
  - Usually a specialized computing environment '

# Edge computing 
- Provisioning processing resource close to the network edge of IoT devices to reduce latency
  - IoT devices on the internet, Devices with very specific functions. A huge amount of data

- Edge computing, application data is on an edge server ( Local system ). 
  - Often process data on the device itself, No latency, no network requirement

# Fog computing 
- A cloud that is close to you data 

- Cloud + Internet of Things 
  - Extends the cloud, Distribute the data and processing. No latency, local decisions made from local data 

- Sensitive data never leaves

- The fog is in the middle, the data is sits there and isnt pushed to the cloud. 

# Thin client 
- Basic application usage; Applications actually run on a remote server, Virtual desktop infrastructure 

- Desktop as a service (DaaS). 

- No huge memory or CPU needs to connect to the cloud, Network connectivity

# Virtualization 
- Runs many different operating systems on the same hardware
  - Each application instance has it own operating system
-  Seprate operating machines, has a guest operating system

- Virtual machines can become expensive

# Application containerization
- Container; Everything you need to run an application, Code and dependenices

- An isolated process in a sandbox; self-contained
