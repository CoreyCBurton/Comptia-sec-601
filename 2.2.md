# Cloud models
# Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
* A cloud storage will give you hardware.

* You are stil responsible for the management of the security.

* Your data is out there, more within your control. You control the operating system 

* Web server providers. 

# Software as a service (SaaS)
* On-demand software - no local installation

* Why manage your own email distribution 

* Central management of data

* A complete application offering; No development work required

# Platform as a service (PaaS)
* No servers, no software, no maintenance team, no HVAC 

* YOu dont have direct control of the data, people. or infrastructure

> Ex: Salesforce.com

# Anything as a service (XaaS)
* A broad description of all cloud models

* Services delivered over the internet

* Usually a specialized computing environment '

# Edge computing 
* IoT devices on the internet, Devices with very specific functions. A huge amount of data

* Desktop as a service (DaaS). 

* No huge memory or CPU needs to connect to the cloud, NEtwork connectivity

# Virtualization 
* Run many different operating systems on the same hardware

* Each application instance has it own operating system

* Seprate operating machines, has a guest operating system
