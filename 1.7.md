# Threat hunting
* A constant game of Cat and Mouse

* Strategies are constantly changing; Firewalls get stronger 

* Intelligence dta is reactive; you cant see the attack until it happens 

* Speed up reaction time

# Intelligence fusion
* An overwhelming amount of security data

* Many data types 

* separate teams such as Security operations, Security intelligence, threat response

# Threat feeds 
* Collect the data; logs and sensors, network information, internet events, intrusion detection 

* Add external sources; Threat feeds, government alerts, and social media 

# Maneuver 
* Firewall rule, block an IP address, delete malicious software 

* automate maneuvers; the computer reacts instantly 

* combine with fused intelligence; ongoing cmbat from many fronts 

# Vulnerability scanning
* Usually minimally invasive; Unlike a penetration test

* Port scan; poke around and see what's open 

* Identify systems; test from the inside and out

* Gather as much information as possible

# Non-intrusive scans 
* Gathering information, dont try to exploit a vulnerability

# Intrusive scans
* Find the vulnerability to see if it works 

# Non-credential scan
* The scanner can't login to the remote device 

# Credentialed scan
* You are a normal user, emulates an insider attack

# Application scans 
* Desktop, mobile apps

# Web applications
* Software on a web server  

# Network scans 
* Misconfigured firewalls, open ports, and vulnerable devices

# Vulnerability research
* National Vulnerability Database

* Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures shows vulnerabilties 

* Microsoft Security Bulletins 

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System 
* Scores vulnerability from 0 to 10 

* The scoring standards do change over time

# False positive
* A vulnerability does not really exit after scan

* It is different than a low-severity vulnerability

# False negative
* The vulnerability exists, you just couldnt detect it
