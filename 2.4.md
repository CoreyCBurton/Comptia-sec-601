# Directory services
* Keep all of an organizations username and passwords in a single database

* Large distributed database

* All authentication requests reference this directory

# Federation
* Provide network access to others, Not just employees, Partners, suppliers, customers, etc. 

* Third parties can establush a federated network, Authenticate and authroize 

* Third parties must establish a trust relationship 

* EX - Log in with twitter, Log in with Facebook, Log in with Linkedin 

# Attestation
* Prove the hardware is really yours, a system you can trust

* Easy when it's just your computer, 

* Remote attestation, device provides an operational report to a verficiation server

* Encrypted and digitally signed with the TPM

* AN IMEI or other unqiue hardware component can be included in report 

# Short message service (SMS)
* Text messaging

* Login factor can be sent via SMS to a predefined phone number

* Input the SMS code in into the log in fourm

* Securits issue exist, Phone number can be reassigned, SMS can be intercepted

# Push notification
* Similar process to an SMS notification

* Usally on a mobile device

* Security challenges, Application can be vulnerable

# Authentication Apps
* Carry around a physical hardware token generator, USe software-based token generator on your phone

# TOTP
* TIme-based One-TIme Password Allorithm

* Secret key is configured ahead of time 

* Timestamp usually increments every 30 seconds 

# HOTP 
* HMAC-based One-Time Password ALhorithm

* Token based authentication, The hash is different every time

# Phone call 
* A voice call provides the token

* The voice will tell you the code 

* phone call be intercepted or forwarded

# Static codes
* Authentication factors that don't change 

* PErsonal identification Number (PIN)

* Can also be alphanumeric, paraphase

# Smart cards
* Intergrated circuit card

* Common on credit cards but also used on identities 

* Multiple factors, Use the card with a PIN or fingerprint

# Niometric Factors ( Something you are )
* Fingerprint scanner, Phones. Laptops, door access 

* Retinal scanner, Inique capillary structure in the back of the eye

* Iris scanner, Texture, color

* Voice recognition, Talk for access

* Facial recognition, shape of the face and features 

* Gait analysis - Identify a person based on how they walk 

* Veins - Vascular scanners, Match the surface of the skin

# Biometric acceptance rates
* False acceptance rate (FAR), Likelihood that an unauthroized user will be accpeted, not sensitive enough

* False rejection rate (FRR), Likelihood that an authorized user will be rejected 

* Crossover error rate (CER), Defines the overall accuracy of a biuometric system 

# AAA Framwork ( Authentication, Authorization, and Accoutning ) 
* Identification, This is who you claim to be, can be your user name 

* Authentication, ORive who you say you are, PAssword and other authentication factors

* Authorization, based on your identification and authentication 

* Accounting, resource used, Login time, data sent, logout time

# Cloud vs on-premises Authentication
* Cloud-based security, centralized platoform, centralized platform, Automation options with API integration 

* On-premises authentication system, Internal moniotring and management

# Factors 
- Something you know
- Something you have
- Something you are 

# Attributes
- Somewhere you are
- Something you can do
- Something you exhibit
- Someone you know 

# Something you know
* It is in your brain, password, 

* PIN and patterns, Not written down, it is in your brain

# Something you have
* Smart card, integrates with devices. It has a PIN. May require a pin

* USB token, A certiciate is on the USB device

* Hardware or software tokens, Generates pseudo-random authentication codes

* Your phone, an sms you have

# Something you are
* Biometric authentication, fingerprint, iris scan, voice print

* Difficult to change, you cant change your password, Not fool proof

# Somewhere you are
* Provide a factor based on your location 

* IP address, not perfect, but can help provide more info 

* Mobile devlice location services

# Something you can do 
* A personal way of doing things, Handwriting analysis

* very similar to biometrics, close but not quite

# Someone you know
* A social factor 

* web of trust

* Digital signature
