#  Threat Actors
* The entity responsible for an even that has an impact on safety on another entity 

* Broad scope of actors 

> Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) 
* Attackers are in the network and undetected; on a FireEye report, 71 days in america, 177 days in EMEA, and 204 days in APAC before they are detected

> Insiders
* more than just passwords on sticky notes

* Attacks can be directed at vulnerable system but he know what to hit 

* Eats away from the inside, they know everything

> Nation state 
* National security; always an external entity

* Highest sophistication; Military, utilities; Stuxnet worm 

> Hacktivist
* A hacker with a purpose; social exchange or political agenda; often external

* Funds are limited

> Script Kiddie
* Runs pre-made scripts without any knowledge of whats happening

* Can be internal or external 

* Not very sophisticated 

> Criminal syndicates
* professional criminals

* Most always external

* very sophisticated

* Crime that is organized 

> Expert with technology
* **white hat** :Authorized; ethical hacker with good intentions 

* **black hat**: Unauthorized; Malicous 

* **gray hat** Semi-authorized; finds a vulnerability but doesnt use it 

> Shadow IT
* Going Rouge; working around the internal IT organization 

* Use the cloud and with Information Technology 

> Competitors
* Many different motivations

* High level of sophistication

* Has many different intents; Shut down your computer, steal customers lists, corrupt manufacturing databases

# Vectors 
> Attack vectors
* A method used by the attacker 

* A lot of works goes into finding vulnerabilities in those vectors 

> Direct access
* Physical access to a system is significant 

* Modifty the operating system; reset the admin password a few times 

* Attach a keylogger to collect username and passwords 

> Wireless
* Default login credentials; modify the access point 

* Rouge access point; A less-secure entry point to the network

* Evil twin; emulates the authentication details; man in the middle attack 

> Email 
* Everyone has an email account

* Phishing attacks 

* Social engineering attacks 

* Deliver malware to the user

> Supply chain 
* Tamper with the underlying infrastructure

* Target was affected by a supply chain attack

* Malware can modifty the manufacturing process 

* Counterfeit networking equipment; install backdoor 

> Social media 
* Attackers thank you for putting personal information online

* User profiling; WHere you were born; what is the name of your school mascot

* Fake friends who try to get additional information

> Removable media attack vectros
* Get around the firewall by usb 

* Malicious software on USB flash drives; infect air gapped networks 

* USB devices can act as keyboards

> Cloud
* Public-facing applications and services

* Security misconfigurations; Data permissions and public data stores

* Brute force attacks 

* Orchestration attakcs

# Threat intelligence
* Research the threats

* Data is everywhere 

* Make decisions based

* Used by researchers 

> Open-source intelligence (OSINT)
* Open source; Publicly available sources

* Internet; Discussion groups, social meda

* Government data

* Commercial data 

> Closed/propreitary intelligence
* Someone else has already compiled the threat information

* Threat intelligence services 

* Constant threat monitoring

> Vulnerability database
* Researches find vulnerabilities

* Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE); A community managed list of vulnerailities; sponsored by the U.S department of homeland Security 

* U.S. National Vulnerbility Database

> Public/Private information centers 
* Public threat intelligence; often classified information

* Private threat intelligence; private companies have resources

* Need to share critical security details

* Cyber threat Alliance (CTA)

> Automate indicator sharing (ALS)
* Intelligence indusrty needs a standard way to share important threats

* Structured threat information eXpression (STIX); describes cyber threat information

> Dark Web
* Overlay networks that use the internet; Requires specific sftware

* Hacking groups and services; Tools and techniques; credit card sales; accounts and passwords 

> Indicator of compromise (IOC)
* An even that indicates an intrusion

* Unusual amount of network activity

* Change to file hash values

* Changes to DNS data

* Uncommon login patterns

*Spikes of read requests to certain files

> Predictibe analysis
* Analyze large amounts of data very quickly 

* Find suspicious patterns 

* Identify behaviors; DNS queries, traffic patterns, location data

* Creates a forceast for potential attacks 

> Threat Maps
* Identify attacks visuall

> File/coe repositories
* Github

* Public code repositories

* Attackers are always looking for this code 

# Threat research 
* Know your enemy

* A never ending process and you cant rely on a single source 

> Vendor website
* Vendors and manufactourers; they wrote the software

* They know when problems are accounced

* THey react when surprises happen; Knows zero days

> Vulnerability feeds
* Automated vulnerability notifications

* Third-party feeds 

* Roll-up to a vulnerability management system 

> Conferences
* Watch and learn 

* Researchers; new DDoS methods

* Stories from the trenches

* Building relationships 

> Acadenuc journals 
* Research from academic professionals 

* Evaluations of exisitng security 

* Detailed post mortem

* Extremely detailed

> Request for comments
* Published by the internet Society 

* Not all RFCs are standard documents 

> Local indusrty groups
* A gethering of local peers

* Associations 

* Industry user groups 

> Social media 
* HAcking group conversations

* Honeypot monitoring on twitter

* keyword monitoring; CVE, Bugbounty, 0-day 

> Threat feeds
* Monitor threat accouncements 

* many sources on information 

> TTP
* Tactics, Techniques, and procedures

* Search through data and networks

* Different types of TTP

* Shows how hackers are doing it
